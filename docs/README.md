# AI Development Tools Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for various AI development tools and protocols, including the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Aider.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized communication protocol that enables AI models to interact with external tools, resources, and services. It provides a structured way for AI models to access and manipulate data, execute code, and interact with various systems.

### MCP Documentation Files

The MCP documentation is organized into the following files:

1. **[MCP Python Documentation](mcp_python_documentation.md)** - Comprehensive overview of the entire MCP Python SDK.

2. **[MCP Python Client Guide](mcp_python_client_guide.md)** - Focused guide on implementing MCP clients in Python.

3. **[MCP Python Server Guide](mcp_python_server_guide.md)** - Detailed instructions for creating MCP servers in Python.

### MCP Key Concepts

- **Server**: An MCP server exposes resources, tools, and prompts to AI models and clients.
- **Client**: An MCP client connects to servers, initializes sessions, and interacts with the server's exposed functionality.
- **Transport**: MCP supports communication via stdio (standard input/output) or SSE (Server-Sent Events).
- **Resources**: Data exposed by servers which can be retrieved by clients.
- **Tools**: Functions that perform operations on behalf of clients.
- **Prompts**: Templates for generating text that can be customized with arguments.

### Getting Started with MCP

To get started with MCP in Python:

1. Install the MCP SDK:
   ```bash
   pip install "mcp[cli]"
   # or
   uv add "mcp[cli]"
   ```

2. Choose your implementation approach:
   - For servers, start with the FastMCP high-level API
   - For clients, use the ClientSession class

3. Refer to the specific guides for detailed examples and best practices.

## Aider: AI Pair Programming

### What is Aider?

Aider is a command-line tool that brings AI pair programming directly to your terminal. It allows you to chat with AI models like OpenAI's GPT models and Anthropic's Claude models to make edits to your codebase, explain code, fix bugs, generate new features, and more.

### Aider Documentation Files

1. **[Aider Python Documentation](aider_python_documentation.md)** - Comprehensive guide to using Aider for AI pair programming.

### Aider Key Features

- Interactive AI pair programming in your terminal
- Support for multiple AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Cohere)
- Git integration with automatic commits
- Voice coding support
- Linting and testing integration
- Repository mapping for context
- Both interactive and scripted usage

### Getting Started with Aider

To get started with Aider:

1. Install Aider:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install aider-install
   aider-install
   ```

2. Navigate to your project and run Aider:
   ```bash
   cd /to/your/project
   aider --model o3-mini --api-key openai=<key>
   ```

3. Start interacting with the AI to make changes to your code.
